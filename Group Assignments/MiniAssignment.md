# Coast Live Oak Project
*By: Caroline Laubach, Ethan Trinh, and Will Callan*

[Project Proposal](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md)

### Roles: 
Will: Project manager, schedules group meetings

Caroline: Repo owner

Ethan: Creating cohesive identity between maps, charts, and presentations

All: Finding data, making maps and charts, coding

### Status update: 
We are generally concerned about the midreview being due at the same time as assignments for other classes but otherwise feel prepared and like we can count on each other (as groupmates) to meet, collaborate, and get our work done. More generally, some of us feel behind, either because it can be hard to concentrate for the entirety of the remote labs or because our schedules don't always fit with the Sunday deadlines. 

Overall, though, we feel like we're in good shape and are working together as a team. 

### Data update: 
*Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.*

As we shared last week, we dowloaded CSV files from iNaturalist containing the locations of [all oaks]() and [coast live oaks](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/coastliveoaksobservations.csv) observed in LA County. We also obtained a [shapefile](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Trees__Bureau_of_Street_Services_.shp) of City of LA street tree coverage from the Bureau of Street Services.

For demographic data, we filtered ACS data down to [racial demographics](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/RacialDemographics.csv) by LA County census tract. For merging purposes, we used the [geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/2020_Census_Tracts.geojson) of 2020 Census Tracts in LA County and the [geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Fire_Hazard_Severity_Zones.geojson) of fire severity zones according to Calfire. We also plan to use a [geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Social_Vulnerability_Index_2020_3062322914535857258.geojson) that spatially details the Social Vulnerability Index of census tracts in LA County. 

**There are a couple data sources we still need to figure out how to download:** [this website](https://landscape.itreetools.org/maps/locations/) allows you to filter data around tree canopy coverage, likely species, land cover, forest risk, land surface temperature, wildlife, etc. [This GIS layer](https://lacounty.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=94f4b807f01e4fd78afd1a1bce1683aa) details survey results in LA County for the gold spotted oak borer (GSOB), which is a threat to coast live oaks.

### Concerns: 
*There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."*

**Major concerns**
- Downloading the above-mentioned datasets on 1) land characteristics and 2) the GSOB. 
- Maintaining a simple, answerable research question
- Producing deliverables for the final using techniques that we haven't yet covered in class

**Minor concerns**
- Finding enough time to collaborate ahead of the midreview
- Carving out enough time for coding
- Issues with pulling/pushing Jupyter content to/from the group repo.
