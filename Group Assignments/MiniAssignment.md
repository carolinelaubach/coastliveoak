# Coast Live Oak Project
*By: Caroline Laubach, Ethan Trinh, and Will Callan*

[Project Proposal](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md)

### Roles: 
Will: Project manager, schedules group meetings

Caroline: Repo owner

Ethan: Helping to create maps/charts based on sources, find data sources/files, help create cohesive identity between maps, charts, presentations?

### Status update: 
*Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.*

Ethan: I think just stressed about the upcoming midreview and the fact that it is at the same time as a lot of other project deliverables for other classes. I also feel behind in class sometimes, especially since it can be hard to concentrate for three hours straight on Zoom. However, I think the group dynamic/structure has like it has worked so far,even with all of our differing schedules. 

### Data update: 
*Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.*

- Csv files downloaded from inaturalist containing locations of [all oaks]() observed and [coast live oaks](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/coastliveoaksobservations.csv) specifically
- [Shape file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Trees__Bureau_of_Street_Services_.shp) from Bureau of Street Services showing street tree coverage in the City of LA
- [Cleaned csv file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/RacialDemographics.csv) of Racial Democragphic data by census tract in LA County
- [Geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/2020_Census_Tracts.geojson) of 2020 Census Tracts in LA County
- [Geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Fire_Hazard_Severity_Zones.geojson) of fire severity zones according to Calfire
- [Geojson file](https://github.com/carolinelaubach/coastliveoak/blob/main/Group%20Data/Social_Vulnerability_Index_2020_3062322914535857258.geojson) spatially detailing the Social Vulnerability Index of census tracts in LA County
- **Need to figure out how to download data:** [this website](https://landscape.itreetools.org/maps/locations/) allows you to filter data around tree canopy coverage, likely species, land cover, forest risk, land surface temperature, wildlife, etc.
- **Also need to figure out how to download data:** [this GIS layer](https://lacounty.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=94f4b807f01e4fd78afd1a1bce1683aa) details survey results for gold spotted oak borer (GSOB) in LA County

### Concerns: 
*There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."*

- One of my concerns is surrounds what we will actually be able to achieve in Python and with the lectures that we will receive over the course of the next five weeks, especially since we will be working on the deliverables for the final before we finish all of the lectures.
- Mentioned in the Slack, but issues with pulling/pushing Jupyter content to group repo and vice-versa.
