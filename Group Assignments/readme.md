# Coast Live Oak Project
*By: Caroline Laubach, Ethan Trinh, and Will Callan*
### Project Proposal

#### Introduction
Through this project, our group hopes to visually explore how the presence of emblematic oak species, such as the coast live oak (*Quercus agrifolia*) and the valley oak (*Quercus lobata*), may be indicative of other social, economic, and even ecological factors in Los Angeles County. For example, does a larger presence of native oaks correlate with higher income areas? Is the presence of wildlife higher in areas with native oaks present? Or what about rates of exposure to harmful environmental events and disasters?  

Significant research, including [this article by Standiford et al.](https://www.fs.usda.gov/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr184/032_Dagit.pdf) published by the US Forest Service, has shown that coast live oaks are extremely resilient in the face of fire. In the aforementioned article, 96% of trees survived after the Topanga Fire of 1993 burned over 20,000 acres of land in Southern California. Other evidence, such as [this article by the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden](https://sbbotanicgarden.org/insight/can-oak-trees-provide-a-natural-fuel-break/), prove that oaks have the ability to act as fuel breaks in the case that a fire does indeed break out both by shading out areas where highly flammable invasive species might otherwise grow and retaining high levels of both interior moisture and exterior air humidity that could help slow the spread of a fire directly adjacent to them. Given these insights, greater knowledge about the presence of oaks in Los Angeles County and their location in relation to marginalized populations could provide insights into whether certain parts of the county are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change-fueled natural disasters as a result of both disinvestment and a lack of native, fire resilient species like the coast live oak. 

At the moment, the scope of our project is just focused on Los Angeles County given the expansive Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) that has played a large role in discussions around climate mitigation and resilience in Southern California. In addition, the recent outbreak of rapidly spreading fires in the Los Angeles region supply a heightened sense of urgency with regard to finding ways that the county can help to prevent future disasters like the recent Eaton and Palisades fires. Time could also be an interesting scope of study in terms of oaks in the region given the recent spread of the golden oak borer (*Agrilus auroguttatus*), an invasive insect that burrows into oaks during the larval stage of its development, greatly decreasing survival rates of oak trees. The oak borer's presence in Southern California could potentially be linked with increased fire vulenerability in the WUI. 

#### Data 

We're currently working with two data sources. The first is a list of observations of Coast Live Oak from iNaturalist: 

https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=962&taxon_id=47850

This crowd-sourced dataset gives us the most accurate available picture of Coast Live Oak presence in LA County. Its primary limitation is that, because it is crowdsourced from users of the iNaturalist app, it may overemphasize Coast Live Oak presence in parts of the county with relatively high concentrations of app users. One possible method of validating the crowdsourced data would be to compare it with a vegetation index such as NDVI. 

Our second data source is the ACS 5-year survey for LA County from both 2022 and 2023, which provides demographic information at the census-tract level:

2022: https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2022_5yr

2023: https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2023_5yr

We plan to merge these datasets to gain insights about the relationship between Coast Live Oak presence and neighborhood characteristics.

#### Analysis and Visualizations

Our analysis of Coast Live Oak presence will be relevant on several levels. First, it will help us describe the relationship between tree presence and neighborhood characteristics, of which we are especially interested in median household income, housing type, and race. With this comparison, we can answer basic questions such as: does wealth in the WUI correlate with the presence of this important natural fire break? What about race? 

Second, beyond mere description, our analysis will support wildfire resilience planning recommendations and interventions. By comparing the location of Coast Live Oaks against varying socioeconomic factors found in LA County census data, we can better understand which communities to prioritize when planning interventions.

We plan to visualize both levels of our analysis. One set of maps will show the locations of Coast Live Oaks in LA County, wiht different colors indicating different densities. Another set of maps will narrow in on census tracts that we judge to be good candidates for interventions involving Coast Live Oak plantings, neighborhood hardening, and other wildfire mitigation efforts. 

In this project, we hope first to demonstrate what we suspect to be an uneven distribution of the Coast Live Oak across LA County's WUI, and second to gain insights that may inform planning interventions.
