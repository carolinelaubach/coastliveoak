### Research question introduction
#### Why this matters: Coast live oaks are a type of evergreen oak native to California. Coast live oaks prevent erosion, support local fauna, and are resistant to low-intensity wildfires. Coast lives oaks can be used as a proxy to understanding the current landscape of ecological biodiversity in Southern California, or more specifically, LA County. Fortifying our green spaces with native flora will help our green spaces thrive as climate change progresses. In addition to building the resiliency of current green spaces, new green spaces must be created and urban forestry efforts should invested in to provide equitable access to nature and shade.   
#### The spatial scope of our project is LA County. By mapping the location of coast live oaks across LA County, we hope to geospatially visualize relationships between varying socioeconomic factors and access to green space. 
#### Data description with links to data sources: Coast Live Oak locations from iNaturalist: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=962&taxon_id=47850
#### Explanation of intended analysis and visualizations: By comparing the location of coast live oaks against varying socioeconomic factors found in LA County census data, we can also better understand which communities to prioritize when planning interventions.
